		<h2>Suggestions 1: Increase contrast/difference of  focus states and original states</h2>
		<div>
			The differences between original text color and the one when hovering or tabbing are not obvious. For example, the text color which is originally grey turns into lightgrey when tabbing or hovering. It's hard for the users who tab through links to identify which links they are tabbing. Therefore, I suggested either to increase the contrast of these two colors or to add some text decorations while hovering to make their differences more significant.
		</div>

		<h2>Suggestions 2: No alt text for images</h2>
		<div>
			There are many pictures on this website. However, all of their alt texts are missing. Since people with low vision mostly make use of "talking browsers", if the alt text is missing, they are not able to realize what this image means or symbolizes by listening to those alt texts which will be converted into speech. Hence, I strongly suggested these images to have their own alt texts. In addition, these alt texts should be specific enough rather than putting "image" as alt text for all images.

		</div>

		<h2>Suggestions 3: Improve style consistency between footer, header, and main content</h2>
		<div>
			The design style (e.g. font family, font size, and colors) of header and footer is not consistent with the one of main content. There are more vivid elements used on main content such as pictures, big font size and font family. I would suggest to improve the consistency in terms of their visual appearance, feeling, and font size to make the website look more harmony.
		</div>

		<h2>Suggestions 4: Do not reply on one sensory characteristics as sole indicator</h2>
		<div>
			On this website, when it comes to highlighting important information or focus states, it only relies on color rather than combining different sensory characteristics such as sounds, shapes, and sizes to provide more clues for the users to identify those information. For instance, the call-to-action buttons change its color only. In terms of these buttons, I suggested to enlarge their font sizes.
